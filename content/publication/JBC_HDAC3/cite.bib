abstract ={In up to 15% of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), a recurring chromosomal translocation, termed t(8;21), generates the AML1–eight–twenty-one (ETO) leukemia fusion protein, which contains the DNA-binding domain of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) and almost all of ETO. RUNX1 and the AML1–ETO fusion protein are coexpressed in t(8;21) AML cells and antagonize each other's gene-regulatory functions. AML1–ETO represses transcription of RUNX1 target genes by competitively displacing RUNX1 and recruiting corepressors such as histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). Recent studies have shown that AML1–ETO and RUNX1 co-occupy the binding sites of AML1–ETO–activated genes. How this joined binding allows RUNX1 to antagonize AML1–ETO–mediated transcriptional activation is unclear. Here we show that RUNX1 functions as a bona fide repressor of transcription activated by AML1–ETO. Mechanistically, we show that RUNX1 is a component of the HDAC3 corepressor complex and that HDAC3 preferentially binds to RUNX1 rather than to AML1–ETO in t(8;21) AML cells. Studying the regulation of interleukin-8 (IL8), a newly identified AML1–ETO–activated gene, we demonstrate that RUNX1 and HDAC3 collaboratively repress AML1–ETO–dependent transcription, a finding further supported by results of genome-wide analyses of AML1–ETO–activated genes. These and other results from the genome-wide studies also have important implications for the mechanistic understanding of gene-specific coactivator and corepressor functions across the AML1–ETO/RUNX1 cistrome.},
