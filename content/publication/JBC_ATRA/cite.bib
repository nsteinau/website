abstract ={CBFA2/RUNX1 partner transcriptional co-repressor 3 (CBFA2T3, also known as MTG16 or ETO2) is a myeloid translocation gene family protein that functions as a master transcriptional corepressor in hematopoiesis. Recently, it has been shown that CBFA2T3 maintains leukemia stem cell gene expression and promotes relapse in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, a role for CBFA2T3 in myeloid differentiation of AML has not been reported. Here, we show that CBFA2T3 represses retinoic acid receptor (RAR) target gene expression and inhibits all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced myeloid differentiation of AML cells. ChIP-Seq revealed that CBFA2T3 targets the RARα/RXRα cistrome in U937 AML cells, predominantly at myeloid-specific enhancers associated with terminal differentiation. CRISPR/Cas9–mediated abrogation of CBFA2T3 resulted in spontaneous and ATRA-induced activation of myeloid-specific genes in a manner correlated with myeloid differentiation. Importantly, these effects were reversed by CBFA2T3 re-expression. Mechanistic studies showed that CBFA2T3 inhibits RAR target gene transcription by acting at an early step to regulate histone acetyltransferase recruitment, histone acetylation, and chromatin accessibility at RARα target sites, independently of the downstream, RAR-mediated steps of transcription. Finally, we validated the inhibitory effect of CBFA2T3 on RAR in multiple AML subtypes and patient samples. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that CBFA2T3 down-regulation is both necessary and sufficient for enhancing ATRA-induced myeloid gene expression and differentiation of AML cells. Our findings suggest that CBFA2T3 can serve as a potential target for enhancing AML responsiveness to ATRA differentiation therapies.},
