abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype that is untreatable with hormonal or HER2-targeted therapies and is also typically unresponsive to checkpoint-blockade immunotherapy. Within the tumor microenvironment dysregulated immune cell metabolism has emerged as a key mechanism of tumor immune-evasion. We have discovered that the Liver-X-Receptors (LXRα and LXRβ), nuclear receptors known to regulate lipid metabolism and tumor-immune interaction, are highly activated in TNBC tumor associated myeloid cells. We therefore theorized that inhibiting LXR would induce immune-mediated TNBC-tumor clearance. Here we show that pharmacological inhibition of LXR activity induces tumor destruction primarily through stimulation of CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic activity and mitochondrial metabolism. Our results imply that LXR inverse agonists may be a promising new class of TNBC immunotherapies.
