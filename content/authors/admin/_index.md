Hey folks, my name is Nick. I'm an MD/PhD student at Saint Louis University, currently in my M3 year. I just finished my PhD in a lab focused on transcriptional regulators, epigenetics, and cancer. I'm interested in the ways medicine can further incorporate cutting-edge genomics technologies (e.g. sequencing, flow cytometry, machine learning) to improve the developing field of precision medicine. Along the way, I've picked up some wet-lab and bioinformatics skills, and am always interested in learning more. Please contact me with any research ideas, questions, collaborations, or obscure funk album recommendations.
