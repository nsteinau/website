Hey folks, my name is Nick. I'm an MD/PhD student at Saint Louis University, currently in my M4 year. My PhD training was in a lab that studied the ways in which transcriptional cofactors cooperated with mutant fusion transcription factors to affect leukemia progression and relapse. Along the way, I've picked up some wet-lab and bioinformatics skills, and am always interested in learning more. I hope to leverage these skills to better understand how hematologic malignancies develop, subclonally evolve, evade therapy, and relapse. Please contact me with any research ideas, questions, collaborations, or obscure funk album recommendations.
